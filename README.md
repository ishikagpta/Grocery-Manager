# Grocery-Manager
Project from CSS 143 UWB course

I wrote a system to manage a grocery store.  The initial store inventory is read from a file.  Orders are read from file.  The system stores the inventory, processes the orders, tracks which items are out of stock, and sorts the inventory list using two different algorithms. A more detailed description file is posted.
